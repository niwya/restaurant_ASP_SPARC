%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SIMPLE RESTAURANT DOMAIN %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This file, written in SPARC (a variant of ASP - Answer Set Programming)      %
% models a simple restaurant layout, with a defined number of customers and    %
% employees.                                                                   %
% This domain is built for an agent to reason on, and the goal is to enable    %
% said agent to perform simple actions (picking or seating customers, taking   %
% orders, bringing bills and diverse items to tables) autonomously in a        %
% restaurant.                                                                  %
